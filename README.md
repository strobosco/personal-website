# Personal Portflio Website

This website will showcase all my professional work experience, side-projects, and fun things I do. As of right now it's serving as an online resumè that contains my side projects as well as my social media links and paper resumè.

This webiste was inspired by [Alexander Grattan's](https://github.com/GameDog9988) personal website and I thank him for the guidance and help he has given me so far.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
